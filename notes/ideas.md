- Planetary Annihilation Style zooming (whole planet)


# Loop
Massive holes of varying size (rarity) around the world that when activated, release a gigantic swarm of enemies:
- Significant ressources and buildings might be allocated to awaking them:
    - They will get destroyed but dedicated units/builds could rebuild them without annoying the player
- Those holes can then serve as teleporters to move across the gigantic map (with nice sprite animations)
- These will then serve as advanced outposts and research centers


# Minimap
- Radar that detects nearby things
    - Augment: gives you the outline of the entire world, on the map, without revealing anything
